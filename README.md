# Bugs-Bakery
Our bakery was started by a girl named Neely Stewart. A lady asked her to make a pie for her. Neely had been into baking for quie some time, so she accepted. The lady loved the pie and said that she should make a bussiness. Neely thought about it and finally did it. She is still baking and looking for more ways to make people happy with her baking skills.

We created a website for my bakery.Bug's Bakery is all home made baked goods.

We used yellow and pink. Yellow is used to increase the hunger of the customer. Pink means innocence, we used this because a human's brain is attracted to innocence and cute things.

She asked us to put in her slogan, which is "we bake for your delight!".

We designed this website to be fun design. We wanted to attract adults but kids as well. We made sure to put in bright colors and many interactive functions.
