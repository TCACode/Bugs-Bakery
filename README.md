# Bugs-Bakery
Our bakery was started by a girl named Neely Stewart. A lady asked her to make a pie for her. Neely had been into baking for quie some time, so she accepted. The lady loved the pie and said that she should make a bussiness. Neely thought about it and finally did it. She is still baking and looking for more ways to make people happy with her baking skills.
